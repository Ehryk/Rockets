Rockets
=======

These are various codes and plans for launching, logging, and controlling model rockets.

##Launchers

Launchers are projects that will ignite the rocket engines, usually housed external to the rocket.

 - CountdownLauncher
 - BluetoothLauncher

##DataLoggers

DataLoggers are meant to be contained within the rocket, and will log various data for future retrieval.

 - v1 - Altitude and Temperature to External EEPROM
 - v2 - Altitude and Temperature to SD Card

##RocketControl

RocketControl systems will combine elements from the launchers and the dataloggers; they will be housed within the rocket, log various data, and also control some ignition events (like drogue ejection and main chute ejection), and may even control or even ignite the main engine.
